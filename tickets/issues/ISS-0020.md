# Update /connect to handle regular tmux sessions

## Description
## Summary

Update the /connect command to allow connection to non-commander tmux sessions with graceful handling of sessions without commander metadata.

## Current Behavior

/connect only accepts commander-prefixed session names and assumes commander metadata exists.

## Target Behavior

/connect works with any tmux session:
- Commander sessions: Full metadata support
- Regular sessions: Basic attach functionality

## Implementation

1. Accept any session name in /connect
2. Check if session is commander-managed
3. For commander sessions: Load metadata, establish full connection
4. For regular sessions: Simple tmux attach without commander features
5. Display appropriate capabilities based on session type

## Graceful Degradation

```
/connect my-regular-session

Connecting to regular tmux session: my-regular-session
Note: This session is not managed by Commander.
      Some features may be limited.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] /connect accepts any valid tmux session name
- [ ] Commander sessions connect with full features
- [ ] Regular sessions connect with basic functionality
- [ ] Clear messaging about feature limitations
- [ ] No errors when connecting to sessions without metadata
