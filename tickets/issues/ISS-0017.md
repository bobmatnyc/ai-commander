  Integrate AgentOrchestrator into the REPL interface to provide consistent orchestration
  behavior.


  ## Current State


  REPL interface communicates directly with the AI adapter without orchestration.


  ## Target State


  REPL uses AgentOrchestrator for message processing, enabling multi-agent coordination
  and task management.


  ## Implementation


  1. Add orchestrator field to REPL struct

  2. Initialize orchestrator during REPL startup

  3. Route user input through orchestrator

  4. Display orchestrator responses appropriately

  5. Handle orchestrator errors gracefully


  ## Estimated Scope


  - ~150 lines of code

  - Similar pattern to TUI integration


  ## Acceptance Criteria


  - [ ] REPL initializes orchestrator on startup

  - [ ] User messages are processed by orchestrator

  - [ ] Orchestrator responses display correctly in REPL

  - [ ] Fallback to direct adapter if orchestrator fails

  - [ ] REPL startup time acceptable'
